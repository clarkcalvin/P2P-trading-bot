Attention, scammers!

Recently, I have received many complaints about fraudsters who, pretending to be my bot, have been spreading malicious software. I want to warn all of you: be careful. Because my bot is popular, many scammers have appeared. So, I am publishing the genuine release of my bot here especially for you. I can't promise that you'll get rich, but I can guarantee you'll earn enough for your needs!

For those who don't know yet, let me tell you a bit about the bot. The trading bot, through the APIs of popular exchanges, helps you make automatic P2P transactions between those exchanges where cryptocurrency rates are most favorable for buying and selling, to maximize profit. Each transaction yields only a few cents, but by making transactions automatically, the bot can execute several thousand per day. As a result, you get a substantial profit.

Why am I giving away the bot for free? you might ask. It's because I'm fed up with paid services that supposedly provide signals for profitable transactions but actually make you lose money. With my extensive experience in programming and finance, I decided to create this bot. It helped me earn money, and now it can help you too.

I wish you luck in your first steps toward financial independence.

Clark Calvin.
